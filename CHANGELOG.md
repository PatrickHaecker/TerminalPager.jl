Version 0.6.6
-------------

- ![Bugfix][badge-bugfix] The help keybinding now works properly with Unicode characters.
  (PR [#57][gh-pr-57])

Version 0.6.5
-------------

- ![Feature][badge-feature] The user can hit `F1` or `Alt + h` to show a pager with the help
  of the current identifier on the cursor. The extended help can be shown by hitting `Alt +
  Shift + h`. (PRs [#49][gh-pr-49], [#50][gh-pr-50], [#51][gh-pr-51], [#52][gh-pr-52],
  [#53][gh-pr-53], and [#55][gh-pr-55])

  [#54][gh-issue-54])

Version 0.6.4
-------------

- ![Bugfix][badge-bugfix] The REPL.jl interface to evaluate expressions was changed in Julia
  v1.11.6. We updated the code to handle the new interface. (Issue [#46][gh-issue-46])

  v1.10+. (PR [#44][gh-pr-44])

Version 0.6.2
-------------

- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] The macro `@help` now correctly interpolates symbols if
  the user does not import all the symbols in TerminalPager.jl. (PR [#41][gh-pr-41])

Version 0.6.1
-------------

- ![Bugfix][badge-bugfix] We now bypass all calls to pager when we are in `pager>` REPL
  mode, avoiding freezing the REPL section (Issue [#40][gh-issue-40])

Version 0.6.0
-------------

- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] We can use the `@help` command on TerminalPager.jl for
  macros. (PR [#39][gh-pr-39])
- ![Deprecation][badge-deprecation] Drop support for Julia 1.6.

Version 0.5.2
-------------

- ![Info][badge-info] Bump StringManipulation.jl version.

Version 0.5.1
-------------

- ![Bugfix][badge-bugfix] Fix the precompilation in Julia v1.6. (PR [#31][gh-pr-31])
- ![Bugfix][badge-bugfix] `TerminalPager.drop_preference!` should not expect the preference
  value, only its name.
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] The error handling algorithm was improved to provide a
  result closer to that of the default REPL mode. (Issue [#32][gh-issue-32])

Version 0.5.0
-------------

- ![BREAKING][badge-breaking] ![Feature][badge-feature] We now manage the user preferences
  using the package Preferences.jl. Hence, we dropped all the previous functions to perform
  customization, leading to breaking changes.
- ![Feature][badge-feature] `^` is mapped to BOL (PR [#28][gh-pr-28])
- ![Feature][badge-feature] The pager supports a new visual mode in which the user can
  select and copy lines.
- ![Feature][badge-feature] The pager can use the alternate screen buffer, which preserves
  the current buffer content. This mode is now the default one when showing documentation
  using `@help` or in the REPL mode `pager?>`. (Issue [#29][gh-issue-29])
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] We use an intermediate buffer to draw the view, leading
  to less screen flickering.
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] The pre-compilation statements are generated by
  PrecompileTools.jl.
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] We now consider the entire display size when showing
  docstrings using `@help`.

Version 0.4.0
-------------

- ![BREAKING][badge-breaking] The REPL mode `pager?` now uses the entire available display
  size to show the help, instead of fixing the number of columns to 80.
  (Issue [#25][gh-issue-25])
- ![Feature][badge-feature] The keys `u/d` are now bound to `:halfup` and `:halfdown`.
  (PR [#22][gh-pr-22])
- ![Feature][badge-feature] The key `<enter>` is now bound to `:down`. (PR [#24][gh-pr-24])

Version 0.3.1
-------------

- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] StringManipulation.jl version was bump to v0.3.

Version 0.3.0
-------------

- ![BREAKING][badge-breaking] The keywords `freeze_rows` and `freeze_columns` were renamed
  to `frozen_rows` and `frozen_columns`.
- ![BREAKING][badge-breaking] The keyword `draw_ruler` was renamed to `show_ruler`.
- ![BREAKING][badge-breaking] The type of keystroke values are now `String` instead of
  `Union{Symbol, String}`. This modification can break code that adds keybindings. However,
  it removed a lot of type instability and runtime dispatch, leading to a substantial
  performance gain.
- ![Feature][badge-feature] The function `set_highlighting` can be used to change the active
  and inactive search highlight decoration.
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] Many performance improvements. The inner engine to
  create text views, called "recipes", was removed in favour of the algorithm in
  StringManipulation.jl (function `textview`).


Version 0.2.2
-------------

- ![Bugfix][badge-bugfix] The escaping was corrected in `@help`. (Issue [#17][gh-issue-17])
- ![Bugfix][badge-bugfix] The text width was being computing without ignoring the
  decoration, leading to problems when accounting for the printable size of the text. (Issue
  [#16][gh-issue-16])
- ![Feature][badge-feature] The keyword `auto` can be used to show the pager only if the
  output does not fit the screen.
- ![Feature][badge-feature] TerminalPager.jl now has REPL modes.
- ![Feature][badge-feature] New keybindings were defined: `<`, `>`, and `b`.  (Issue
  [#15][gh-issue-15])

  pager. (Issue [#6][gh-issue-6])
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] Many performance issues were fixed, improving the
  initialization time among other things.

Version 0.2.1
-------------

- ![Deprecation][badge-deprecation] The macro `@dpr` is now deprecated. It was replaced by
  `@help`.
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] The macro `@stdout_to_pager` can now be called using the
  shorter name `@out2pr`.

Version 0.2.0
-------------

- ![Feature][badge-feature] The macro `@stdout_to_pager` can be used to redirect the
  `stdout` output to the `pager`. (Issue [#13][gh-issue-13])
- ![Feature][badge-feature] The macro `@dpr` can be to easily access the documentation of a
  function using `pager`. (Issue [#14][gh-issue-14])
- ![Feature][badge-feature] A vertical ruler can now be drawn using the keybinding `r`.
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] `space` is now bind to `:pagedown` as in `less`.

Version 0.1.1
-------------

- ![Bugfix][badge-bugfix] When selecting the new number of columns and rows that will be
  frozen, hitting just enter uses the old value instead of crashing.
  (Issue [#9][gh-issue-9])
- ![Bugfix][badge-bugfix] Avoid a crash when searching something without matches after a
  search with matches. (Issue [#12][gh-issue-12])
- ![Feature][badge-feature] The function `TerminalPager.debug_keycode()` was added to help
  debugging key codes.
- ![Feature][badge-feature] The navigation can now be performed using a set of Vi key
  bindings. However, due to some conflicts, the entire navigation set based on Vi key
  bindings requires the environment key `PAGER_MODE=vi`. (Issue [#7][gh-issue-7])
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] `ALT` is now treated like `Meta`, trying to equalize the
  experience among different operation systems. (Issue [#8][gh-issue-8])
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] If there is no match, the command line now shows `(no
  match found)` instead of `(0 of 0 matches)`.
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] `ALT up` and `ALT down` now goes to the beginning and
  end of the text to keep consistency of `ALT` modifier. (Issue [#8][gh-issue-8])

Version 0.1.0
-------------

- ![Bugfix][badge-bugfix] The number of cropped lines is now correctly computed.
  (Issue [#3][gh-issue-3])

  [#1][gh-issue-1])
- ![Feature][badge-feature] The pager now supports features, which are a set of actions that
  can be disable when calling it. For example, the pager is used to show the help screen.
  However, in this case, we remove the `help` feature to avoid showing another help screen.
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] A new rendering algorithm for better performance.
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] The new rendering algorithm does not add new lines when
  clearing the screen, but overwrite the current ones. (Issue [#4][gh-issue-4])
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] The help screen now shows all the important information.
- ![Enhancement][badge-enhancement] A lot of type instabilities were fixed, leading to a
  much better initialization time.
